                Sri Lanka, the tropical island located under the southern
                part of India. As the rest of the world says, “Pearl of the Indian Ocean”.
                The beauty of Sri Lanka doesn’t stop there, it indeed is an Island filled
                with mountainous forests filled with deep green lush and sandy beaches coving
                every bit of the coast. Sri Lanka isn’t just filled with greenery and
                breathtaking views, but also with a rich culture ageing back 100s of
                years.

                        <h2>Religion</h2>
                        Sri Lanka is an Island where the whole population follows 4 major religions

                        <br>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Buddhism</li>
                        <li>Muslim</li>
                        <li>Christianity </li>
                        <li>Tamil</li>
                    </ol>

                    <br>
                    Buddhism being the major religion followed by many Sri Lankan which is around 70.2% out of the total
                    population and the rest of the percentage being divided over the 3 majorly followed religions.
                    The nice thing about this is each Sri Lankan citizen celebrates one another religion when it comes
                    to celebrating their holy days/ festivals. This also includes every citizen having an open mind
                    about ones another religion, culture and lifestyle meaning these spreads more of a peaceful society
                    to each Sri Lankan living and all visitors are welcomed with opened hands to embrace their families’
                    customs.

                        <h2>Spices</h2>
                        Starting from the history, the Sri Lankan cuisine was very
                        much based off natural spices when it comes to flavoring the dishes
                        . Indeed, a Sri Lankan meal can light up your taste
                        buds like no other which is why it is a must try! When
                        visited. The space palette is so vastly spread that around
                        30,000 tons of spices s exported to international borders.
                        This includes.


                    <ul>
                        <li>Ceylon Cinnamon</li>
                        <li>Ceylon Pepper</li>
                        <li>Ceylon Cloves</li>
                        <li>Ceylon Cardamon</li>
                        <li>Ceylon Nutmeg</li>
                    </ul>

                    Each spice got its own flavor, smell and shape meaning
                    it has its own role when it comes to making the dish.
                    The geographical location of Sri Lanka plays a major
                    role of having to grow this many spices with its
                    consistent rain for certain areas and harsh sunlight
                    at places.

                        <h2>Languages</h2>
                        Sinhala and Tamil are the most widely spoken languages
                        across the island making it the main two languages of
                        Sri Lanka. Sinhala is mainly spoken by Sinhalese which
                        adds up to around 16 million citizens from the total
                        population making it their mother tongue and is also
                        used by other religions. Looking back at the roots and
                        the history of the Sinhala language, it was with the
                        Indo-European group of scripts of the Indo-Aryan branch.
                        Sinhala language got its own way of writing which adds up
                        cultural value to the country to have its own language.
                        Second being the Tamil language, it is mainly used by the people in the Northern
                        part of Sri Lanka whereas the major population of the northern are Tamils coming
                        also from the northern part of India and Tamil being their mother tongue. This
                        community of Sri Lanka adds up to about 28.5% of Sri Lanka which is 4.7 million
                        citizens in numbers. English is also being used by many citizens of Sri Lanka and
                        widely spoken around in the younger generations.
